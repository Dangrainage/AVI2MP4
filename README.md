 needed a converter for my old camera, since It records in AVI, I figured .mp4 would be a good file format to convert to. Someone else might need It, right? (Converts all .AVI files in the folder to .mp4 files and adds them to a mp4s folder It also makes)

 # HOW TO USE

 Add the 'converter.sh' file to your directory with .AVI files, open your terminal and navigate to your .AVI directory, run ```bash converter.sh``` - it'll handle the rest.
 ffmpeg has to be installed for the script to work.
